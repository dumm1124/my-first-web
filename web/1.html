    <strong>hello</strong> <u>world</u>
    Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899 – July 2, 1961) was an American novelist, short-story writer, and journalist.
    <br><br><br>
    <p>His economical and understated style—which he termed the iceberg theory—had a strong influence on 20th-century
        fiction,
        while his adventurous lifestyle and public image brought him admiration from later generations.</p>
    <p style="margin-top: 90px;"> Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and he was
        awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature.

    He published seven novels, six short-story collections, and two nonfiction works. Three of his novels, four short-story
    collections,
    and three nonfiction works were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of American
    literature.
